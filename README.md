This is my first project built in a blockchain made 100% by me. It is implemented a way to securely play the mythic rock paper scissors game in a manner that players can not cheat. The web design is awful because web design is not my main focus since I have been building just the functionality.

Things that I learnt along the way:
- Create image transition in css
- Create a carousel of cards in css
- Configure a subgraph to index smart contracts logs and make the queries with different filters and to return different information. Basically first contact with graphQL queries.
- Connect wallet button and change network made manually to learn about the different api requests that can be made to the wallets to perform different tasks. I know there are a lot of options to use connect wallet buttons, but I prefered to create manually one in a context to have a good setup to program all the other logic.
- Web3.js functionalities. Previously I worked with ethers.js, however I wanted to try this other library and it resulted to be pretty much the same, so more knowledge is always welcome.
